# Another approach: Visualization using Echarts
# This chunk will generate an author table and a relation table between authors. The next procedure will be processed in authorinfo_toecharts.py. 'authorinfo_toecharts.py' will generate a type of data that can be processed in Echarts.

```{r}
library("rjson")

table_for_json <- read.csv("data/sna_table.csv")
rownames(table_for_json) <- c(0:412)

author_table <- table_for_json %>%
  select(name = 1)

table_for_json <- table_for_json[,-1]
colnames(table_for_json) <- c(0:412)
table_for_json[lower.tri(table_for_json, diag = TRUE)] <- NA
table_for_json[table_for_json == 0] <- NA
matrix <- table_for_json %>% as.matrix

list_for_json <- melt(matrix)
list_for_json <- na.omit(list_for_json)
list_for_json <- list_for_json[, -3]
colnames(list_for_json) <- c("source", "target")
write.csv(author_table, "data/author_table_echarts.csv")
write.csv(list_for_json, "data/relation_echarts.csv")
