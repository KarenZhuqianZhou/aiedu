Improving Engagement in Program Construction Examples for Learning Python Programming.\n                    Int J Artif Intell Educ 30, 299\u2013336 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-020-00197-0", "abstract": "This research is focused on how to support students\u2019 acquisition of program construction skills through worked examples. Although examples have been consistently proven to be valuable for student\u2019s learning, the learning technology for computer science education lacks program construction examples with interactive elements that could engage students. The goal of this work is to investigate the value of the \u201cengaging\u201d features in programming examples. We introduce PCEX, an online tool developed to present program construction examples in an engaging fashion. We also present the results of a controlled study with a between-subject design that was conducted in a large introductory Python programming class to compare PCEX with non-interactive worked examples focused on program construction. The results of our study show the positive impact of interactive program construction examples on student\u2019s engagement, problem-solving performance, and learning."}
